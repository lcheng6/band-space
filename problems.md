Step 1: Define a problem.  Please list three or more specific problems under your name below.  Brainstorming rules apply (no stupid ideas, and aim for yes, and discussion instead of no, but at this stage).  If you have a specific project idea, then identify the problem it solves first and then add notes about project below it.

"Musicians Venue Guide"
App will allow subscribed users to list information on venues where they have performed including contact info for the talent buyer
and a rating system to receommend a venue and provide feedback for other potential ats to review.
The venue could also be a subscriber and add updated info to the database.

We need to develop a way for users to give pertinent feedback that can be "verified" by other users possibly with a tab that will "confirm" or update specific info.
