Step 1: Define a problem.  Please list three or more specific problems under your name below.  Brainstorming rules apply (no stupid ideas, and aim for yes, and discussion instead of no, but at this stage).  If you have a specific project idea, then identify the problem it solves first and then add notes about project below it.
