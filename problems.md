Step 1: Define a problem.  Please list three or more specific problems under your name below.  Brainstorming rules apply (no stupid ideas, and aim for yes, and discussion instead of no, but at this stage).  If you have a specific project idea, then identify the problem it solves first and then add notes about project below it.

1. Keeping track of information as I search for an apartment.  You need to search multiple sites, rewrite very similar query emails for each one, keep track of appointments and locations, and you constantly feel like you might be missing a great property.  You also need to fill out and track contact information, notes and maybe photos for each property you visit, fill out the different applications for each property, etc.  When you're searching for properties, you either need solid local knowledge or to do multiple google map searches for each property to see how far from preferred stores/groceries, kids school, work and other landmarks in your life.  Also, each site is giving you notifications in a different way, some to email, some within the site itself, some just by phone.  Also, its hard to set an effective radius for a search because what you really want isn't x miles from a point, but a place where you have a reasonable commute each way, including any school drop-offs etc.
  *Project idea*
  MVP: Site where you can collect information on apartments, including link to listing, contact information for landlord, application status/progress, scheduled visits, notes/photos from visits.

  Feature ideas:
  - Chrome extension (think similar to pinterest pin this) that grabs link and gives you fields to add additional information. Potential to grab pertinent listing details (npm package for craigslist, zillow has an API). Turns out chrome extensions are basically just css/html/javascript!
  - Users give daily routine information -- school drop-off at 8 am, commute to work, pickup from school at X time, ballet class on Wednesday, etc, and we show how each property would fit into that schedule.
  - Communications tracking.  Work as a central platform for the communications (send sms, log phone calls, track emails) and/or let users forward emails or manually enter communication details.
  - Complex search filtering.  Let me set my preferences (walkable to parks, max times for routines, near a whole foods or trader joes.  Query craigslist, zillow, maybe others for results, then filter by criteria.  Basically imagining instead of setting a radius, I can give a few key landmarks/times, weight them by importance and give results that fit those criteria (searching a blob defined by travel times for my actual life, not a radius distance)
  - I don't like the form inquiries, but find that I'm sending basically the same email with every inquiry. Let users designate a default inquiry and autofill reply or query either by sending it through out site or tossing content into clipboard from extension or our site.  

2. (Context of legal service clinics, but I think its a broader problem): When I ran consumer law clinic, we would have a limited time to help customers and spent a lot of that time getting basic information, then would need to find the right forms, hand write them out for customer to file in court or notes for them about their situation.  
  *Project Idea* Supervisor uses a UI to desigining interactive question flow (think flow-chart) and output forms/types.  Customer walks through questions and provides information and gets a unique identifier (data stored in database).  Service-provider uses that identifier to get summary of data and/or editable pre-created form/document to review, can jump into interview with far better information.  If a different form is needed (or an additional one), can change or add the forms, add information, and edit results. Customer information is either destroyed or locked in a secure manner (i.e. encrypted with key that customer gets printed out and has to keep if they want to re-access data at subsequent visit).

  - For legal context, information about case may exist in publicly accessible case information database or on papers customer brings with them. Grab data from website/api or capture and OCR information from forms, use to pre-fill forms/database.  

  (I'm planning to build this as a portfolio piece, but could make a solid project if people interested)

3. I hate filling out forms by hand and its harder than it should be to type onto the PDF with built-in tools.  

  *Project Notion* It'd be super neat if I could throw form (think rental application) into site and then just click where I want to type, add the necessary information, then export a flattened pdf for print/email.  Bonus points for option to save data for editing/revision later.  Extra bonus point if I can save frequent information and drag icons to areas of form for pre-filling with optional repositioning.

"Musicians Venue Guide"
App will allow subscribed users to list information on venues where they have performed including contact info for the talent buyer
and a rating system to receommend a venue and provide feedback for other potential ats to review.
The venue could also be a subscriber and add updated info to the database.

We need to develop a way for users to give pertinent feedback that can be "verified" by other users possibly with a tab that will "confirm" or update specific info.
