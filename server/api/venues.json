Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.  The Velvet Lounge isn&#39;t like any of those places, but it does schedule excellent local performers specializing in psych, punk, and rock.  As anyone that has bought tickets to performances at the Velvet Lounge knows, the focus here is on excellent music, inexpensive drinks, and great people.  \n\nThe Velvet Lounge sets itself apart from the other bars and clubs on U Street by keeping it simple.  Bands play upstairs to frenzied crowds while those looking for relief from the crowds can linger downstairs, and there&#39;s nearly always someone interesting to talk to.  Drinks are simple and inexpensive; people looking for elaborate, $10 organic cocktails will be out of luck.  The schedule of performers will never feature a big name star, but will feature talented, popular musicians that are at the heart of the local music scene.  Audiences looking for a nitty, gritty live music experience should check out the frequent happenings at the Velvet Lounge.\n\nCheck the schedule above to see what performers (and maybe parties) the Velvet Lounge has lined up for this week, or just stop in to one of Washington D.C.&#39;s most authentic live music venues.","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/400/693-7.jpeg_/the-velvet-lounge-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/400/693-7.jpeg_/the-velvet-lounge-93.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/400/693-7.jpeg_/the-velvet-lounge-93.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/400/693-7.jpeg_/the-velvet-lounge-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night Club","venue_name":"The Velvet Lounge"},{"geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","event_count":"0","trackback_count":"0","comment_count":"0","region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20024","latitude":"38.8787427","url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/zanzibar-on-the-waterfront-/V0-001-000220023-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"V0-001-000220023-2","address":"700 Water Street SW","city_name":"Washington","owner":"evdb","link_count":"12","country_name":"United States","longitude":"-77.0239221","timezone":null,"country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","country_abbr2":"US","name":"Zanzibar on the Waterfront","description":"There is a parking lot across the street from the club.","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/400/574-3.jpeg_/zanzibar-on-the-waterfront-74.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/400/574-3.jpeg_/zanzibar-on-the-waterfront-74.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/400/574-3.jpeg_/zanzibar-on-the-waterfront-74.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/400/574-3.jpeg_/zanzibar-on-the-waterfront-74.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night Club","venue_name":"Zanzibar on the Waterfront"},{"geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","event_count":"0","trackback_count":"0","comment_count":"0","region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20007","latitude":"38.9213110","url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/grog-tankard-/V0-001-000431782-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"V0-001-000431782-8","address":"2408 Wisconsin Avenue NW","city_name":"Washington","owner":"evdb","link_count":"2","country_name":"United States","longitude":"-77.0725140","timezone":null,"country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","country_abbr2":"US","name":"Grog & Tankard","description":"202-333-3114\n\nThe Grog and Tankard has been a local favorite for 40 years.  \nIt’s the longest running bar with live music in the DC Metropolitan area, best\nknown for hosting a variety of local and nationally known music bands.  \nVertical Horizon, Hootie and the Blowfish, Lost Trailers, and thousands of\nothers have played at the Grog.  &quot;If it&#39;s not happening for you at the Grog,\nyou need to reassess&quot; - Matt Scannell, singer and guitarist for Vertical\nHorizon.\n\nThe friendly atmosphere, great music, and stacked bar with 14 microbrews\non tap make the Grog and Tankard the perfect place for a break any night\nof the week.

DC9 schedules some of the best local musicians and musical events in town, and provides a first class facility to host them.  Dozens and dozens of tickets are bought by loyal regulars for these indie and alternative performances, and the main reason patrons come back to DC9 again and again.\n\nAnother reason is the club itself which, while not the biggest club around, provides numerous seating options to comfortably accommodate the large crowds that can show up any day of the week.  Modern furniture and lighting fixtures add some flair to the otherwise simply decorated club whose main eye candy is the long, heavy bar.  There is another, smaller bar and booths upstairs, but most people gravitate to the slightly raised stage where scheduled musicians perform nearly every day of the week.  It&#39;s also where the DJ stands every Friday night for the Liberation Dance Party, a dance night featuring the newest hottest electronic, hip-hop, and rock dance music.\n\nAudiences at DC9 get the exciting events and scheduled performers of a big club, mixed with the friendliness and comfortability of a neighborhood bar.","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/401/080-6.jpeg_/dc9-nightclub-80.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/401/080-6.jpeg_/dc9-nightclub-80.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/401/080-6.jpeg_/dc9-nightclub-80.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/401/080-6.jpeg_/dc9-nightclub-80.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night Club","venue_name":"DC9 Nightclub"},{"geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","event_count":"23","trackback_count":"0","comment_count":"0","region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20036","latitude":"38.9062273","url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/18th-street-lounge-/V0-001-000490969-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"V0-001-000490969-2","address":"1212 Eighteenth Street NW","city_name":"Washington","owner":"liquidcooper","link_count":"4","country_name":"United States","longitude":"-77.0418722","timezone":null,"country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","country_abbr2":"US","name":"18th Street Lounge","description":null,"image":null,"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night Club","venue_name":"18th Street Lounge"},{"geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","event_count":"71","trackback_count":"0","comment_count":"0","region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20009","latitude":"38.9213","url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/ny-ny-diva-/V0-001-007297744-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"V0-001-007297744-3","address":"2406 18th St NW","city_name":"Washington","owner":"WPGC955Events","link_count":"3","country_name":"United States","longitude":"-77.0383","timezone":null,"country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","country_abbr2":"US","name":"NY NY Diva","description":null,"image":null,"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night Club","venue_name":"NY NY Diva"},{"geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","event_count":"58","trackback_count":"0","comment_count":"2","region_abbr":"DC","postal_code":"20002","latitude":"38.9000886","url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/rock-and-roll-hotel-/V0-001-000419869-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"V0-001-000419869-4","address":"1353 H Street NE","city_name":"Washington","owner":"Lambo1","link_count":"5","country_name":"United States","longitude":"-76.9865771","timezone":null,"country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"District of Columbia","country_abbr2":"US","name":"Rock and Roll Hotel","description":"The Rock and Roll Hotel is Washington DC&#39;s most famous live venue and &quot;hotel&quot;.

During the 1940s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt hosted several of his birthday parties at the Lincoln Theater. The theater fell into disarray after the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots and eventually shut its doors.  A revival effort took place in 1993 when the theatre was named to the National Register of Historic Places.  It was restored and reopened in 1994 with a performance of <i>Ain&#39;t Got Long to Stay Here</i>, a play detailing Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s biography. \n\nThe theatre can comfortably host 1,250 patrons for events ranging from the performing arts, stand-up comedy, and live musical events from contemporary artists.  It has recently become a haven for the revival of jazz music and has featured performances by Quincy Jones and Chuck Brown.

The Bohemian Caverns schedule is jam packed with all of your favorite local and national jazz performers and features a full restaurant and bar.  The club went into a period of decline during the &#39;70s but has subsequently been revived to its former glory.  Join the Bohemian Caverns as it celebrates over 80 years as Washington DC&#39;s beloved Jazz venue.  Register with Eventful to receive regular updates and to purchase tickets for all of your favorite local events. \n\nThe Bohemian Caverns restaurant and Jazz Nightclub is located at 11th and U Streets in NW Washington DC.  It was founded in 1926 as a venue for variety shows and was frequented by such legends as Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway.  By the 1950s the name of the club was changed to Crystal Caverns eventually settling on Bohemian Caverns.  During the 1960s, The Bohemian Caverns was the premier jazz club and ushered in the era of jazz music for the city.  The club was able to book jazz superstars such as Miles Davis, Shirley Horn, John Coltrane, and Charles Mingus.  \n\nBy the turn of the decade, however, the club went into a state of disarray and it was closed.  Following revitalization efforts in NW Washington DC, the club was renovated and reopened to its former glory.   Now the venue is once again DC&#39;s premier jazz nightclub, featuring several performances each week by national acts.  The venue also features a full service restaurant/bar and is the perfect venue for jazz aficionados.  Don&#39;t miss a date on the Bohemian Caverns concert calendar.  Use Eventful as your source for the Bohemian Caverns schedule and never miss out when your favorite performers visit a venue near you.","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/401/562-5.jpeg_/bohemian-caverns-62.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/401/562-5.jpeg_/bohemian-caverns-62.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/401/562-5.jpeg_/bohemian-caverns-62.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/401/562-5.jpeg_/bohemian-caverns-62.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":null,"venue_type":"Bar/Night
